    "# Sensor Confirmation\n",
    "In this notebook the data exploration for Sensor Confirmation will be presented. Assumptions about sensor pairs will be explained and visuals to support certain actions will be provided, i.e., offset and scaling of sensor readings. The goal is to determine how feasible Sensor Confirmation is given data readings from a set of independent sensors that resolve to the same information.\n",
